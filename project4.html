            <p class="project__desc">This was a personal project that I created for a restaurant landing page. The main purpose was to create such a page with awesome design that makes you want to buy food from that restaurant instantly! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                The main focus was on creating a user-friendly page that is as modern and up-to-date as possible. Minimalism was the goal here, and I made sure that the site is appealing and yet not too crowded with loads of details.

            <p class="project__imgtxt">Section of Page</p>
            <p class="project__desc">The site was implemented with HTML, CSS (including SASS and the BEM architecture methodology) as well as JavaScript where that was necessary. The site was made responsive and suitable for all kinds of devices. </p>
