            <a href="https://yamo93.github.io/natbyggab/" target="_blank" class="viewproject">View Project Here!</a>
            <p class="project__desc">This was another school project where I was given the task to create a landing page for a company. I chose to create a page for a fictional web development agency which I gave the name "NÃ¤tbygg AB", simply translated to "Net Construction AB".</p>
            <p class="project__desc">I planned the project by choosing a convenient theme, colors, fonts and images. I then planned the overall structure of the page and illustrated it in a sitemap seen below:</p>
            <div class="project__sitemap sitemap3"></div>
            <!-- Maybe show sitemap instead? -->
            <p class="project__imgtxt">My Sitemap</p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                I finally reached the point where it was time to start developing the site using basic HTML and CSS along with the SASS preprocessor. I tried to implement the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) CSS architecture (as I usually do in my projects), mostly because it makes development much easier and also because it solves the specificity problem that often occurs when developing in CSS.
            </p>
            <div class="project__section section3"></div>
            <p class="project__imgtxt">A Section of the Page</p>
            <p class="project__desc">I spent plenty of time making sure that the website was compatible with the most frequently used browsers and responsive and user-friendly in all kinds of devices. When everything was done, it was time to publish it online and deploy it to the Web! ðŸ™‚</p>
