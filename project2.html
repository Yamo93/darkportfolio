            <p class="project__desc">This was a project where I created a landing page for a real estate. Gathering inspiration from multiple real estate pages, I finally added my own personal touch to it and composed this responsive, page with HTML, CSS and basic Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic functionality such as opening up modals and so on.</p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                The main focus of the project was to create an intuitive site with a modern approach. One of my main focuses was to make sure that the site is accessible from smaller screen devices.

            <p class="project__desc">
                I also added some JavaScript functionality such as being able to reach out to the Web and grab information about real estate companies located in various cities in Sweden (try it out yourself by <a href="https://yamo93.github.io/realestate/index.html#estimate" target="_blank">navigating to the section</a> displayed by the image and type the name of a Swedish city). This was achieved by making an asynchronous call with the built-in Fetch API in the browser.
