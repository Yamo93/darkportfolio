            <p class="project__desc">This e-shop was created as part of a school project at the university. The task was to create a shop of some fashion and follow through the entire process from designing the product, develop it with code and finally deploy it to the Web.</p>
            <p class="project__desc">I paid great attention to choosing the appropiate theme for this online bookshop, picking out convenient colors. My main designing tools were Adobe XD and some basic Photoshop editing.</p>

                Once I had my fonts, colors and images ready, I designed specific mockups for every section of the website. Now, it was time to get my hands dirty with code! ðŸ˜€

            <div class="project__mockup mockup1"></div>
            <p class="project__imgtxt">A Mockup of the Bookshop</p>
            <p class="project__desc">Since my mockups and graphics were neatly created, it was relatively easy to develop the user interface of the page with HTML and CSS. I used the SASS preprocessor to speed things up using the helpful features provided by SASS, such as using reusable mixins, writing nested styles and much more. I also spent quite a lot of time improving the JavaScript side of the page, providing dynamic functionality such as being able to add/remove items to a basket or a wishlist, checkout and so on.</p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                The project is still open for further development. I'm planning on turning this site into a React-based application, and eventually use Node.js for the backend and be able to store items on a real database (document-based such as MongoDB).
