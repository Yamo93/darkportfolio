            <p class="project__desc">This was initially a school project where I was given the task to create a blog portal with PHP for the server side and MySQL as a relational database management system.</p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                I aimed to create a minimalistic and user-friendly blog portal while using simple features but still providing the user with the expected functionality of a typical blog portal.
            </p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                Some of the implemented functionality on the page was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User registration and authentication.</li>
                <li>CRUD operations such as creating, reading, updating and deleting posts.</li>
                <li>Creating bookmarks, comments and likes.</li>
                <li>Uploading profile images.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project__section project__sectionsmall section5"></div>
            <p class="project__imgtxt">The Comment Section</p>
            <p class="project__desc">The site was implemented with HTML, CSS (including SASS and the BEM architecture methodology) as well as JavaScript where that was necessary. The site was made responsive and suitable for all kinds of devices. </p>
            <p class="project__desc">
                I also used several Bootstrap components which was a big time saver and also made the responsive part easier to implement, since they are initially made to be responsive.
            </p>
